# ECE 3260 Control Systems Lab

**Course Description**: Simulation of dynamic systems. Demonstration of control system analysis and design techniques using hardware (we will focus on software) experiments.

I will be applying the readings I do on control systems in Python, as I am more familiar with it than MATLAB.
